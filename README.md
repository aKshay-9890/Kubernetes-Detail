# Kubernetes-Detail

What is Kubernetes?
==> 
Kubernetes is an open-source Container Management tool that automates container deployment, container scaling, descaling, and container load balancing (also called a container orchestration tool).
Kubernetes is an open-source platform that manages Docker containers in the form of a cluster. Along with the automated deployment and scaling of containers, it provides healing by automatically 
restarting failed containers and rescheduling them when their hosts die. This capability improves the application’s availability.

Features of Kubernetes:
1.Automated Scheduling– Kubernetes provides an advanced scheduler to launch containers on cluster nodes. It performs resource optimization.
2.Self-Healing Capabilities– It provides rescheduling, replacing, and restarting the containers that are dead.
3.Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks– It supports rollouts and rollbacks for the desired state of the containerized application.
4.Horizontal Scaling and Load Balancing– Kubernetes can scale up and scale down the application as per the requirements.
5.Resource Utilization– Kubernetes provides resource utilization monitoring and optimization, ensuring containers are using their resources efficiently.
6.Support for multiple clouds and hybrid clouds– Kubernetes can be deployed on different cloud platforms and run containerized applications across multiple clouds.
7.Extensibility– Kubernetes is very extensible and can be extended with custom plugins and controllers.
8.Community Support- Kubernetes has a large and active community with frequent updates, bug fixes, and new features being added.


Benefits of Using Kubernetes
1. Automated deployment and management
If you are using Kubernetes for deploying the application then no need for manual intervention kubernetes will take care of everything like automating the deployment, scaling, and containerizing the application.
Kubernetes will reduce the errors that can be made by humans which makes the deployment more effective.
2. Scalability
You can scale the application containers depending on the incoming traffic Kubernetes offers Horizontal pod scaling the pods will be scaled automatically depending on the load.
3. High availability
You can achieve high availability for your application with the help of Kubernetes and also it will reduce the latency issues for the end users.
4. Cost-effectiveness
If there is unnecessary use of infrastructure the cost will also increase kubernetes will help you to reduce resource utilization and control the overprovisioning of infrastructure.
5. Improved developer productivity
Developer can concentrate more on the developing part kubernetes will reduce the efforts of deploying the application.
